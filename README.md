# One Sheet Solo Play Project for FORGE

This is a small project I created to help me understand solo play better using the **[F.O.R.G.E.](https://zap-forge.itch.io/forge)** (*Fantasy Open Roleplaying Game Engine*) system and have a quick and easy sheet to reference when playing.

The sheets come in PDF format of A4 size in two pages. They should be printed two-sided. Make sure when printing you select the options "Fit to printable areas" and for best quality select 600 dpi, not 300 dpi.
